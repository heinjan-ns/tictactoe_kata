# tictactoe_kata
Tic tac toe kata project

First stab at making the tic tac toe bot to bot kata

Make it in typescript, with TDD. I don't have any experience doing TDD or starting a new project in typescript
* jest seems 'easier' than mocha, so I'll choose jest as test framework
* via https://michaeljohnpena.com/blog/typescript-tdd/ I will follow the setup-tutorial
To initialise the project:
`npm init -y`
To install the typescript compiler and jest:
`npm install -D typescript jest @types/jest`

To try to run a test, it seems it needs additional packages:
`npm install -D ts-jest`

To test the things:
`npm test`

To build the project:
`npm run build`

To start the things:
`npm run start`
