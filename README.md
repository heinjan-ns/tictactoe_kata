Tic tac toe kata project

First stab at making the tic tac toe bot to bot kata

Make it in typescript, with TDD. I don't have any experience doing TDD or starting a new project in typescript
* jest seems 'easier' than mocha, so I'll choose jest as test framework
* via https://michaeljohnpena.com/blog/typescript-tdd/ I will follow the setup-tutorial
